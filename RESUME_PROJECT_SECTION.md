## Option 2: Detailed Version (If you have more space)

**TranslateMe - AI-Powered Translation Testing Extension** | Personal Project | [Date Range]

**Project Overview:**
Developed and published a Chrome extension that automates translation quality assurance testing for web applications, helping QA teams and developers identify untranslated content and translation issues across multiple languages.

**Key Achievements:**
- **Automated Testing Solution**: Built an AI-powered testing tool that scans web pages in real-time to detect translation issues, eliminating manual inspection of multilingual content
- **Full-Stack Development**: Designed and implemented backend infrastructure using Supabase (PostgreSQL) for user management, authentication, and usage tracking with secure OAuth 2.0 integration
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented intelligent batching and parallel processing, reducing API calls from 50+ to 1-3 requests per page scan
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Resolved OAuth authentication issues for Brave browser, ensuring compatibility across Chromium-based browsers
- **Production Deployment**: Successfully published to Chrome Web Store (v1.0.2) with 100+ active users, implementing proper error handling, user feedback, and compliance with Chrome Web Store policies

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Frontend**: Chrome Extension (Manifest V3), JavaScript ES6+, DOM manipulation, Chrome Storage API, Content Scripts
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL), RESTful APIs, Database functions (RPC), Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth 2.0, Chrome Identity API, Session management
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 API, streaming responses, prompt engineering for translation analysis
- **Testing & QA**: Cross-browser testing, error handling, user acceptance testing

**Impact:**
- Reduced translation QA time from hours to minutes for localization teams
- Identified 1000+ translation issues across various web applications
- Improved test coverage for multilingual applications
